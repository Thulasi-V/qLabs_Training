    <h3> Root Vegetables</h3>
    <p><strong>Root vegetables</strong> are underground plant parts eaten by humans as food.
        Although botany distinguishes true roots (such as taproots and tuberous roots)
        from non-roots (such as bulbs, corms, rhizomes, and tubers,although some contain both hypocotyl 
        and taproot tissue), the term <em>"root vegetable"</em>is applied to all these types in agricultural and culinary usage (see terminology of vegetables).

<h3>Leaf Vegetable</h3>
<p>Leaf vegetables, also called leafy greens, salad greens, pot herbs, vegetable greens, or simply greens,
     are plant leaves eaten as a vegetable, sometimes accompanied by tender petioles and shoots. 
     Although they come from a very wide variety of plants, most share a great deal with other
      leaf vegetables in nutrition and cooking methods.

    <h3>Marrow</h3>
    <p>A <strong>marrow </strong>is a vegetable, the mature fruit of certain Cucurbita pepo cultivars.
        The immature fruit of the same or similar cultivars is called courgette
         (in Britain, Iran, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, Singapore, Malaysia and New Zealand) or 
         zucchini (in North America, Japan, Australia, the Czech Republic, Italy, Germany and Austria).
          Like courgettes, marrows are oblong, green squash, but marrows have a 
          firm rind and a neutral flavour ("overgrown when picked and insipid when cooked"),
          making them useful as edible casings for mincemeat and other stuffings.

        <h3>Stem Vegetable</h3>
        <p>
            The category <strong>“Stem vegetables” </strong>includes plants of which the stems are used as food, 
            for example asparagus is a stem vegetable. 
            The shoots of some species of bamboo are edible and are therefore also classified as <em>stem vegetable</em>.<br>
