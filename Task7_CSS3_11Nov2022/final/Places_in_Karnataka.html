    <h3 id="#Bengaluru">Bengaluru</h3>
    <p >Bangalore ( officially <strong>Bengaluru</strong>, is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Karnataka. It has a population of more than 8 million and a metropolitan 
         population of around 11 million, making it the third most populous city and fifth most populous urban 
         agglomeration in India, as well as the largest city in South India, and the 27th largest city in the world.
          Located on the Deccan Plateau, at a height of over 900 m (3,000 ft) above sea level, <em>Bangalore</em> has a pleasant 
          climate throughout the year. Its elevation is the highest among the major cities of India.<em>Bangalore</em> is widely 
          regarded as the "Silicon Valley of India" because of its role as the nation's leading information technology 
          (IT) exporter.The city's history dates back to around 890 CE, as found in a stone inscription found at the Nageshwara Temple in Begur, Bangalore. In 1537 CE, Kempé Gowdā – a feudal
           ruler under the Vijayanagara Empire – established a mud fort, considered 
           the foundation of modern Bangalore and its oldest areas, or petes, which still exist. 
           After the fall of the Vijayanagar empire, Kempe Gowda declared independence; in 1638, 
           a large Adil Shahi Bijapur army defeated Kempe Gowda III, and Bangalore was given to them as a jagir 
           (feudal estate).The Mughals later captured Bangalore and sold it to Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar (1673–1704), the then ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore.When Haider Ali seized control of the Kingdom of Mysore, the administration of Bangalore passed into his hands.

According to the epic Mahabharatha, a man-eating Rakshasa named Hidimba and his sister Hidimbi lived on the hill. Hidimba was a source of terror to everyone around, while Hidimbi was a peace-loving rakshasa. When the Pandavas came with their mother Kunti in the course of their exile, Bhima had a duel with Hidimba in which Hidimba was killed. Bhima married Hidimbi and they had a son named Ghatotkacha, who had magical powers. Legend has it the boulders were part of the arsenal used by Bhima during that duel.

         formation in the country
